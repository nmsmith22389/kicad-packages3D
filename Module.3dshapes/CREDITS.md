### Module.3dshapes: RaspberryPi_Pico...
Authored by Peter S. Hollander (recursivenomad) in 2022 through the [Ki-Lime Pi Pico](https://gitlab.com/recursivenomad/ki-lime-pi-pico/) project with custom parametric [FreeCAD models](https://gitlab.com/recursivenomad/ki-lime-pi-pico/-/blob/main/models/RaspberryPi_Pico_Variations.FCStd).  
Used FreeCAD 0.20.2, KiCad StepUp 10.7.7, and some good ol' manual editing of VRML files.
